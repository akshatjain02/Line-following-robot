# Line-following-robot

The Arduino code for the Line Following Robot that we built using Arduino IDE. 

An array of IR LED sensors is used to detect the black line on white surface. Based on the status of sensors, special circuit or controller decides the position of line and also the required direction of motion required to follow the line. Motor driver circuit is used to ON/OFF the LEFT/RIGHT motors of the robot to provide desired motion.
